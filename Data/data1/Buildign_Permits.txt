Background

A building permit is an official approval document issued by a governmental agency that allows you or your contractor to proceed with a construction or remodeling project on one's property. For more details go to https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-a-building-permit-1398344. Each city or county has its own office related to buildings, that can do multiple functions like issuing permits, inspecting buildings to enforce safety measures, modifying rules to accommodate needs of the growing population etc. For the city of San Francisco, permit issuing is taken care by www.sfdbi.org/

Why is this important: In the recent past, several posts and blogs highlighted that main discrepancy in demand and supply in real estate industry is due to delays in issuing building permits. Refer:

Challenges

May be some of the questions that can be answered are:

Can you try predicting permit issue times for various permit types? Which ones matter more?
Can you suggest which is the best week day to visit Department of building inspections, based on this data?
Can you conclude anything on the city's developments based on this data?
